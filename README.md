# Seth Roberts - Table Project

## Overview
This project is designed to create a dynamically sized 2D table templated class.

## Resources Used
I referenced [cppreference.com](https://cppreference.com) for information on memory management. Additionally, I used **Visual Leak Detector** and had to search online, including using AI, to figure out how to install and integrate it into my project. I frequently referred to class notes as well. These were the only external resources I utilized.

## Potential Improvements
- I could **optimize** the resize function to minimize unnecessary element movement.
- I only tested with other types a few times, so I might expand testing if I were to revisit this project.
- I believe I **laid out** the code much better this time. I focused on function placement and structuring the code for improved readability.
